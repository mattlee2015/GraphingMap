Project 4
TA: Edward

Description:
the point of this project was to create a graph of the UR campus, Monroe, and NY. Basically could divide doing this project into 4 parts. But other than creating the graph structure there was also the visual representation needed to "draw out the map".

Directions to running code:
* can also be run on eclipse

1) move the source files to desktop
2) go to terminal
3) enter "cd Desktop"
4) Enter “javac *.java”
5) Enter “java Graph map.txt”
or “java Graph map.txt - show”
or “java Graph map.txt - directions i1 i2”
or “java Graph map.txt -show -directions i1 i2”
or “java Graph map.txt - meridianmap”
or “java Graph map.txt -show -meridianmap”




runtime:
to make the graph the cost should be O(log (n)).
